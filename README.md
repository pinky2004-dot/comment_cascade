# üïµÔ∏è Comment Cascade

A Reddit-based word-guessing game where players try to identify famous Reddit posts based on progressively revealed comments. Built on Reddit's Devvit platform, this game combines the thrill of deduction with the authentic content that makes Reddit special.

## How It Works

**Comment Cascade** presents players with redacted comments from real Reddit posts. Your mission: guess the original Reddit post URL! 

- **Start**: See 5 redacted comments with key words hidden as `[___]`
- **Guess**: Enter what you think is the Reddit post URL
- **Reveal**: Each wrong guess reveals more words from the comments
- **Win**: Correctly identify the post to win the game!

The game features a **progressive reveal system** similar to Wordle - making each wrong guess more helpful than the last, while still maintaining the challenge.

## Project Story

### The Vision
The idea for Comment Cascade emerged from a simple observation: Reddit's comment sections often contain the most interesting and revealing content about a post. What if we could turn this into a game? A game where players use their knowledge of Reddit culture, subreddit patterns, and comment context to solve puzzles.

### Development Journey

#### **Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Mechanics**
The project began with building a solid foundation using Reddit's Devvit platform:

- **Project Setup**: Created the app using `npx create-devvit-app@latest --template=react`
- **Backend Architecture**: Implemented Express.js server with Reddit API integration
- **Frontend Development**: Built React-based UI with TypeScript for type safety
- **Game Logic**: Developed the core puzzle generation and validation system
- **Redaction System**: Created intelligent text redaction that preserves context while hiding key details

#### **Sprint 2: Dynamic Content & Progressive Reveals**
The second phase focused on making the game truly dynamic and engaging:

- **Real Reddit Integration**: Replaced mock data with live Reddit posts and comments
- **Subreddit Curation**: Selected 10 text-focused subreddits for optimal puzzle content:
  - AskReddit, TIFU, TodayILearned, ExplainLikeImFive
  - UnpopularOpinion, AmItheAsshole, Relationship_Advice
  - LifeProTips, Showerthoughts, MildlyInfuriating
- **Progressive Reveal System**: Implemented Wordle-style word revelation based on incorrect guesses
- **Daily Puzzle System**: Added Redis caching for consistent daily puzzles across all users
- **Error Handling**: Built robust fallback systems for API failures

#### **Technical Challenges & Solutions**

**Challenge 1: Reddit API Integration**
- **Problem**: Initial attempts to fetch Reddit data were failing silently
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive error handling and multiple API call methods
- **Result**: Reliable data fetching from 10+ subreddits with real-time content

**Challenge 2: Dynamic Puzzle Generation**
- **Problem**: Ensuring puzzles were challenging but solvable
- **Solution**: Developed intelligent redaction algorithms that preserve context while hiding key identifiers
- **Result**: Balanced difficulty with engaging gameplay

**Challenge 3: Performance & Caching**
- **Problem**: Reddit API rate limits and slow response times
- **Solution**: Implemented Redis-based daily puzzle caching
- **Result**: Fast, responsive gameplay with reduced API calls

**Challenge 4: Progressive Reveal Logic**
- **Problem**: Creating a fair and engaging reveal system
- **Solution**: Built word-tracking system that reveals words in order of importance
- **Result**: Each wrong guess provides meaningful hints without spoiling the answer
